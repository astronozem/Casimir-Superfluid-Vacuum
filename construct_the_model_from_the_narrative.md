The vacuum is a relativistic superfluid whose ground state is set by the expansion of the universe itself. Because the cosmos expands at a steady rate H₀, every volume of empty space experiences a universal, extremely gentle flow of the superfluid: a phase gradient ∇θ = H₀/c everywhere. In a superfluid, any such background flow creates an energy gap for excitations — the same way a current in superfluid helium prevents the formation of vortices below a critical velocity. Here the gap is tiny, Δ ≈ ℏ H₀, because the cosmic flow is extraordinarily slow.

This gap has an immediate consequence. The vacuum can only create new spacetime by exciting quasiparticles above that gap. In empty de Sitter space it does so at a steady rate proportional to H₀, producing the observed cosmic acceleration.

Now place ordinary matter somewhere. Matter curves spacetime, which tries to curve the superfluid as well. But the superfluid resists small disturbances: as long as the acceleration it feels from the baryons is much smaller than the cosmic gap expressed as an acceleration scale — namely g† ≈ c H₀ / 2π — the vacuum can freely adjust its density and flow to screen the curvature. The Casimir effect proves this screening must be perfect: the vacuum’s zero-point energy between plates is completely blind to whether those plates are on Earth or in free fall; therefore the vacuum itself cannot know about local gravitational curvature. The only way to reconcile this blindness with the presence of matter is for the vacuum to change the rate at which it creates new spacetime in response to that matter.

When baryonic acceleration is very weak (far below g†), the superfluid easily excites modes above the cosmic gap, so new spacetime pours in copiously. The resulting inflow toward the baryons is perceived as a large additional acceleration — exactly the “dark-matter-like” boost seen in galaxies.

When baryonic acceleration becomes large compared to g†, the required excitation energy rises. Because the superfluid gap is fixed by the cosmic flow, the only way to reach higher energies is by stretching the distance over which the phase changes — the healing length grows as 1/√g_baryon. The number of available modes that can fit above the gap therefore drops exponentially with the square root of the local acceleration. Consequently, new spacetime creation shuts off extremely rapidly once g_baryon ≫ g†. Gravity reverts to pure General Relativity with extraordinary precision — which is why we never noticed anything strange in the Solar System or neutron-star binaries.

The transition is governed by a single function: the fraction of the maximum possible creation rate that remains allowed once the healing length is stretched by the local baryonic field. That fraction is 1 − exp(−κ √(g_baryon / g†)), where κ is an order-unity number fixed by the detailed microphysics of the superfluid (observations of galaxies demand κ ≈ 1.2). Adding the inflow contribution to the ordinary Newtonian term yields the total observed acceleration felt by stars and gas in galaxies — with no further free parameters.

Because the suppression is exponential in the square root, not in the acceleration itself, the theory recovers General Relativity faster than any power law in strong fields, while producing exactly the observed radial acceleration relation in the weak-field regime where dark matter was thought to dominate.

Remarkably, the only functional form that has ever been found to fit the observed radial acceleration relation across all rotationally supported galaxies with essentially no intrinsic scatter is g_obs = g_baryon / (1 − exp(−√(g_baryon / a₀))) (McGaugh et al. 2016, Lelli et al. 2017). We used the end point of this equation and the theory above to look for similarities and we found it.


The same physics must be expressible in a fully relativistic, diffeomorphism-invariant way.The low-energy effective theory of a relativistic superfluid whose condensate is softly broken only by the preferred cosmological frame (the frame in which the CMB is isotropic) is known to be described by a handful of allowed terms: a function of X = −½ ∂μθ ∂μθ, a chemical-potential-like coupling Y = uμ ∂μθ (where uμ is the cosmological four-velocity), and possible non-analytic functions of the matter stress-energy tensor T_b^{μν}.The Casimir blindness requirement forbids any term that is analytic in the curvature scalar R or the baryonic stress-energy tensor T_b^{μν}; the dependence on local matter must enter through a non-analytic function (such as an exponential or a square root) of a scalar built from T_b^{μν} alone. Using only these ingredients — and the requirement that the quasi-static, weak-field limit must reproduce exactly the observed galactic acceleration law derived above — write the minimal, ghost-free, causal relativistic action.
