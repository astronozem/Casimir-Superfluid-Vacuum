We need to work on the new 1.7 paper, because there is new math, @new_math.md, read it.
The version we need to revise is in @README.md, read it.

We need to solidify the paper with the new math and insights, in a most careful manner. 
Some of the statements are not true anymore, and need revision.
And some of the math has changed and needs revision.

No simplifications of the math, in fact we need to be very precise.

We need to make sure the new PAPER_1.7.md is the perfect faultless combination of the README and new_math.

Tread very carefully and be extra cautious.
Markdown with latex support, so no full tex, no unicode, only ascii, markdown.
